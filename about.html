            About Me
            <br>
            <br>
            My name is Alex Tsoi, I am currently studying digital creative media at the College of International Education. I love what I do, and I hope that it shows!
            <br>
            <br>
            I like games and movies, especially animation. I think the most exciting part of it is that they allow us to experience things that may never happen in real life. That's why people read books, don't they? We don't go anywhere, but in a weird way, we do. Any bring some positivity back into real life. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I don't want to go on to an industry or a career that I won't enjoy for the rest of my life. I want my future career to come from a place of love and face new challenges every day. I am self-motivated and eager to learn. I want to become a professional animator as my future career and an indie game developer during my free time. 
            <br>
            <br>
            ... So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and take a look!
